type: correlation
status: test
description: |
    Detects when 5+ NHI security events originate from the same source IP
    within 600 seconds. This catch-all correlation identifies complex,
    multi-stage attacks that span multiple NHI rule categories and indicates
    a sophisticated attacker or automated attack tool.
    Derived from Wazuh rule 100954 (frequency=5, timeframe=600s, same_source_ip).
