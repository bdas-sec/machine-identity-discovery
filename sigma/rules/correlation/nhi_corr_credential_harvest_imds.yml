description: |
    Detects when credential harvesting activity is followed by cloud metadata
    service access within 120 seconds. This attack chain indicates an attacker
    first collecting local credentials, then pivoting to cloud infrastructure
    via IMDS to steal IAM role credentials.
    Derived from Wazuh rule 100950 (timeframe=120s).
