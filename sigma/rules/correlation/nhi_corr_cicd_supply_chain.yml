description: |
    Detects when CI/CD token exposure (GitHub/GitLab) is combined with git
    credential file access within 300 seconds. This attack chain indicates
    an attacker collecting both CI/CD pipeline tokens and repository credentials
    to execute a software supply chain attack.
    Derived from Wazuh rule 100952 (timeframe=300s).
