description: |
    Detects when an AI agent SSRF attack (IMDS access) is combined with
    credential file access within 120 seconds. This is a critical indicator
    of a fully compromised AI agent being used to exfiltrate both cloud and
    local credentials, likely via prompt injection.
    Derived from Wazuh rule 100953 (timeframe=120s).
