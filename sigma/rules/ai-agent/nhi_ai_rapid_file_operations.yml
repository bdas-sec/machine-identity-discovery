description: |
    Detects an AI agent performing rapid credential file scanning (20+ accesses
    within 60 seconds by the same user). Tuned down from original threshold of
    50 for earlier detection. Groups by user to correlate agent activity.
    Derived from Wazuh rule 100854 (production-grade, frequency=20, timeframe=60s).
